Questions

1. Both Wireshark and NetWitness Investigator can be used for packet capture and analysis. 
   Which tool is preferred for each task, and why? 
   Wireshark -> packet capture & NetWitness Investigator -> analysis
   NetWitness Investigator has a limitation of 1G protocol capture per session but Wireshark doesn't have such limitation
   Wireshark can be used to analyze capture files, but netWitness Investigator is a seven-layer  protocol analyzer that
   provides detailed protocol analysis and protocol behavior analysis.
2. What is the significance of the TCP three-way handshake for applications that utilize TCP as
   transport protocol

3. How many different source IP host address did you capture in your protocol capture?
	9| 172.30.0.2, 192.168.1.99, 172.16.8.99,172.16.0.99, 172.30.0.11, 172.30.0.10, 172.17.8.99, 172.16.20.99,0.0.0.0 
4. How many different protocols did your protocol capture session have? What function in Wireshark provides
   you with a breakdown of the different protocol types on the LAN segment?
   Address Resolution protocol, transmission control protocol, ssh protocol, ISO 8073/x.224 COTP connection-Oriented Transport Protocol
   File Transfer Protocol, User Datagram protocol, SMB(Server Message Block Protocol), SMB MailSlot Protocol, Microsoft Windows broswer Protocol,
   Trivial File Transfer Protocol, Internet Group Management Protocol,
	
	Wireshark -> Statistics -> protocol hierarchy
   
5. How and where can you find Wireshark network traffic packet size counts? Can you distinguish how many of 
   each packet size was transmitted on your LAN segment? Why is this important?
   Wireshark -> statistics -> packt lengths. 
   we can know it through the packet length distribution data 
   ?
6. why is it important to use protocol capture tools and protocol analyzers as an information systems security professional?
	By using these protocol capture and analysis tools, we could make up a benchmark which can be used for experts to know which is the normal traffic
	and which is abnomal. In addition, these tools help experts to locate problems and respond to them as soon as possible. 
	
7. What are some challenges to baseline analysis?
   For baseline analysis, we met the following challenges: simplifying the data for better analysis, dealing with large-size capture file,
   working with multiple tools to gain an accurate perspective on the netwrok.
8. Why would an information systems security practitioner want to see netwrok traffic on both internal and external network traffic
	By scanning both internal and external network traffic, experts can be better prepared to prevent some attacks from succeeding.
9. Which transactions in the lab used TCP as a transport protocol? Which used UDP? Which ports were used in this lab.
	Telnet(port 23), SSH(port 22) , FTP(port 21), rdp(3389) use TCP
	netbios-dgm(port 138), NetBIOS name service - netbios-ns (port 137), TFTP(69) -> UDP
