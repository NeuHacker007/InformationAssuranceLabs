Asset => what you are trying to protect

Threat => what you are protecting against - any action that could damage an asset.

bulnerability => any weakness or gap in your security

risk => intersection of assets, threats and vulnerabilities. Asset + Threat + Vulnerability = Risk
		Risk can only be mitigated rather than completely eliminated.
		
Threats
		- Intentional
			eg. malicious software | disgruntled employee 
		    Motivation
					- anger 
					- greed
					- Notoriety -> people want win fame thourgh the attack
		
		- Unintentional 
					eg. hardware failure, application failure, natural disasters
Vulnerability
		 - Insecure servers
		 - Exploitable applications and protocols
		 - Poorly configured network devices
		 - Unprotected systems or network resources
		 - Traffic interception and eavesdropping reveal private communicatioin to unauthorized parties
		 - Lack of preventive or protective measures allows malware to infiltrate the network
Criminal profiling => categorizing various of types of computer criminals based on general observations

Window of vulnerability(Wov) => covers a timeline from the moment a vulnerability is discovered by a potential attacker
							    and identified by the vendor, a fix is created and published and the fix becomes know  and 
								finally applied.
Roles in mitigating attacks
		manner -> firewall, intrusion detection systems, anti malware software, access control, etc.
		
		security professioinals => plan, design, monitor security systems
		Networking professionals => install and support security sytsems.
		
security person must
					- Work out a solution to control risk and mitigate threats
						- easy to implement
						- how effective
					- consider the scope of an attack
						eg. what is affected, how might one attack lead to another attck, what can hakers do when they 
						    get the privilege 
					- evaluate the security solution 
Security gap => the difference between estabilished security controls and controls needed to address all vulnerabilities
		mitigation solution
						1) Identify => identify risk by determining and classifying the risks that might affect your resources 
						2) Analyze => perform qualitative or quantitative risk assessments. Rank risk in the order of their importance
						3) Plan => Determine strategies for addressing each risk 
						4) Respond => avoidance, transference,mitigation and acceptance (4 primary methods for responding to negative risks)
