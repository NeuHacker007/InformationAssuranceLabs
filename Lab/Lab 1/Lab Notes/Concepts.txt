Goal of ISS -> protect information's confidentiality, integrity and availability
Confidentiality => only authorized user can view information
Integrity => only authorized user can change information
Availability => authorized user can access information whenever they need

Laws -> ISS 
1. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act -> secure patient information
2. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act -> produce accurate and reliable financial reports (Integrity)
3. The Children's Internet Protection Act -> public school to use and enforce an Internet safty policy

IT information security framework
Policy : short written statement that defines a course of action; 
		  applies to the entire organization
		-> Standard: detailed written definition of how software and hardware are used
		-> procedure: instructions for how to use the policy and standard
		-> guideline: a suggested course of action for using the policy, 
					  standard or procedure
					  
7 Domains

 1) User Domain -> 
 2) Workstation Domain => where most users enter the IT infrastructure
 3) LAN Domain => LANs organized by function or department
				- Server -> hub
 4) LAN - WAN Domain => From this point, IT infrastructure steps in to wider area -- WAN & Internet
				- Router -> Firewall
 5) WAN Domain => Connect WAN over Internet
 6) Remote Access Domain => connect remote end user(employee,parterner) to the IT Infrastructure
 7) System/Application Domain => holds all-misson-critical systems, applications and date.

Confidentiality 
				- enforce stringent access control
				- enforce strong authentication
				- use strong encryptioin and virtual private network tunneling for secure Ip communications
				- provide security awareness training to users
				- Have user sign an acceptable use policy
?Integrity
				- Moniter for threats 
				- Perform regular network and system vulnerability assessment
				- Use uninterrupted power supplies to help avoid data corruption
				- For highly critical or sensitive data, perform end-to-end checksums on data transfers.
Question: In the book it said that integrity is somebody got a full version of sofware without authentication and being autherized. So, how can we understand the first two.
		  it seems has no relationship with the book definition
		  
Availability: 
			   - Use redundant systems, storage, and power supplies.
			   - as far as possible, eliminate single points of failure in your infrastructure
			   - apply filters on exterior IP stateful fire walls and IP router WAN interfaces to reduce chances of DoS attacks
			   - Implement daily data backups and off-site data storage for monthly data archiving
			   - use a data classification system to properly label sensitive or private data
			   - Develop a disaster recovery plan specific to the recovery of mission-critical applications and data to maintain operations

Roles in protecting C-I-A:
		 - User: weakest link in security chain <- training, policy
		 - Security Admin: design, execution maintenance security (Manage assets pertinent to network | systems defense | manage vulnerability and threats | implement contermeasures)
		 - Network Admin: manage resources and change resources | they make sure the security policies are properly implemented from technical aspect. 
		 - HR personnel:  provide security policy trainings to employee 
		 - Senior management: ultimately responsible for security (set strategic direction & expectations for security policy | assign responsibility to the necessary resources
																   to ensure the creation of security policy | understanding the risks facing the org.)
		 - Third party vendors: help ensure availibility of systems, networks and communications | perform as SLA( Service-Level-agreement 
																													eg. user acceptable downtime of their services)
DoS attack solutions
					 - apply TCP_SYN patch
					 - implement router filters
					 - disable unnecessary services and firewalls
					 - enable user quotas

  security incident driven
  
 
 assignment:
    background: malware attack, information leakage
	questions: 
				- How world you assess the risks,threats and vulnerability that may have allowed this incident to occur or could allow a similar incident to occur in future
				- What insights about risks, threats and vulnerabilities can you glean from reports of similar incidents that have occured in other org.
				- What potential outcomes should the company anticipate as a result of the malware attack and possible exposure of Intellectual property
				- Which countermeasures would you recommend the company implement to detect current vulnerabilities, respond to teh effects of this and other successful attacks
				  and prevent future incidents
	requirement:
				- write an outline of key points
