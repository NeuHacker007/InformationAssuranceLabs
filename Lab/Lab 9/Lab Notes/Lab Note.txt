The Windows Firewall with Advanced Security is a personal firewall that filters incoming and outgoing traffic by blocking unauthorized 
traffic to the local computer. It can be configured to support separate profiles based on whether the computer is connected to a network 
at the office, or connected at home, or at a public location, such as the local coffee shop. Using the Advanced Security profiles, 
network traffic can be filtered based on Active Directory users and group, both source and destination IP addresses, port number, 
specific programs and services.

Enabled on the network and properly configured, a firewall can block outside sources from being able to insert malware and viruses. 
By default, the Windows Firewall disables several important services like File Transfer Protocol (FTP) and 
Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP), which includes the Ping command. In the next steps, 
you will manually configure the Windows Internal Firewall to enable the ICMP service on the vWorkstation machine.
