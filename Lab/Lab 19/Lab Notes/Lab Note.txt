 The Incident Response Team, of which you are now a member, arrived at work today to find a trouble ticket was generated by a nightly system check. One of the Windows workstations on the network is likely infected with some type of malware.

Per your incident response policy, you have determined that this event truly constitutes an incident and you take action to limit additional damage. You instruct the help desk to have the user of the machine cease all activity and contain the infected machine bydisconnecting from the network (unplug Ethernet cable or disable wireless), leaving it isolated but not powered off. It should be left in its steady state. This isolates the contaminated workstation from the organization’s network and Internet, as well as preventing the contamination from spreading. Logs, memory forensics, footprints, and other malicious activity must be kept in its steady state untouched until you arrive on scene.

In the next steps, you will download the incident response template that you will use throughout this lab to document your investigation of the incident.
