asymmetrical encryption
	=> the sender has two keys: a private key and a public key. 
	   the sender encrypts with her private key and the receiver decrypts using the sender's public key,
	   which the receiver obtains from the sender or through a trusted third party
	   
drawback
	- much slower 
benefits 
	- guarantee the authenticity 

symmetric encryption
	=> the sender and receiver use the same key to encrypt and decrypt a given message 
benefits 
	- fast
	- easy to implement 
drawback	
	- doesn't guarantee authenticity
hybrid approach
	=> the sender encrypt the message with a symmetric key, and then send the message and a copy of the symmetric
	   key using the sender's asymmetric public key. The initial message and sysmmetric public key are decrypted using the 
	   sender's public key, and subsequent messages are then decrypted quickly using the symmetric key
benefits 
	- full CIA protection as asymmetrical
	- speed as sysmmetric
