The Comment box can remain empty. While not required to create a key pair, 
it can be useful if you are creating a certificate for a specific purpose, such as testing or for 
a specific client. If you do add a comment, it becomes part of your login name, 
and will be visible to the receiver

When the key is successfully created, you have several options for handling the key:

    Make a Backup Of Your Key Pair. This option sends a copy of your private key to your computer where you can store it anywhere you'd like.

    Send Certificate By EMail. This option will create a new e-mail and automatically attach your public key certificate.

    Upload Certificate To Directory Service. You can store your certificate on a public Internet server.
