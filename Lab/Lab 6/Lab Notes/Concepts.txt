BCP => a plan designed to help an organization continue to perate during and after a disruption. 
		- purpose and scope
		- assumptions and planning principles
		- System description and architecture
		- Notification or activation phase
		- Recovery and reconstitution phases
		- Training plan, testing, and excercises
		- Maintenance plan
DRP => specific steps and procedures to recover from a disaster.
		- Critical business function (CBF) 
			=> any function considered vital to an organization. if a CBF fails, the organization will lose 
			   the ability to perform critical operations necessary to meet its mission.
		- Maximum acceptable outage (MAO)
			=> the maximum amount of time a system or service can be down before affecting the organizatioin's mission.
			   this directly affects the requried recovery time.
		- Recovery time objective (RTO)
			=> the time frame during which a critical system or function must be recovered.
			   the RTO <= MAO
	elements:
			- purpose and scope
			- disaster or emergency declaration
			- communications
			- emergency response and activities
			- Recovery steps and procedures
			- Critical business operations
			- Recovery operations
BIA  => a study that identifies the CBFs and MAOs of a DRP. 
			- includes interviews, surveys, and meeting. 
			- identify the impact of the failure of one or more IT functions on the business. 
			- identify the priority of different critical systems. 
			- scope can include the entire organization. 
CIRP => outlines the steps taken during a response effort and the roles and responsibilities of the CIR team (CIRT)
	    members in case an incident occurs. 
			- who launched the attack
			- what type of attack occurred
			- where did the attack occurred
			- when did the attack occur
			- why did the attack occur
			- how did the attack occur
Risk assessment
	- Identify threats and vulnerabilities
			- Identify the likelihood that a risk will occur
					- Identify asset values
						- Determine teh impact of a risk
							- Determine the usefulness of a safeguard or control.
							
Quantitative risk assessment
	=> gathering data and then entering it into standard formulas. the result can help you identify the priority of risks and determine the effectiveness of
	   security controls. 
		- single loss expectancy (SLE) => the total loss expected from a single incident.
		- Annual rate of occurrence (ARO) => the number of times an incident is expected to occur in a year
		- annual loss expectancy (ALE) => the expected loss for a year. ALE = SLE X ARO 
Qualitative risk assessment 
	=> using a scale to define the probability that a risk will occur. can be low, medium, high
	=> the term impact is used to identify the magnitude of a risk 
	=> the risk lecel is calculated by multiplying the probability value by the impact value.
