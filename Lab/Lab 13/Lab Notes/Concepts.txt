Footprinting => reveal important technical information about an organization 
			-	first phase of hacking. It involves steps to collect information about the victim computer system 
				and determine the network range. 
A hacker can use the following sources when footprinting an organization
	- The organization's Web site
	- The organization's contact information
	- Resumes of key employees
	- Job decriptions of key roles
	- Details of important events,policies and standards
	- Information about Domain Name systems, Internet Protocol ranges, server names, routing information, and mail servers
Tools 
	Whois => gain information about an organization's physical address, phone numbers and other contact details
	Nslookup => extract information about an organization's IP addresses and main servers.
	Traceroute => identify the path that a specific data packet on a network will take to reach its destination

footprint steps
		-> Review public presence => Find out information about the organization from publicly available sources
			-> perform DNS enumeration => Locate information about the domain server of the organization
				-> Use nslookup and gather zone data => Extract information about IP addresses and mail servers of the organization
					-> Perform trace routes => Track data packets on a network to gain information about the hosts on a network
						-> review main servers => Analyze the mailing servers of an organization to find out additional information
							-> analyze data => Analyze teh data and information gathered by all means and plan for the next step in hacking

Importance of footprint => help them safeguard their information from hackers with mallicious intentions.
White hat => use footprint to find vulnerabilities and devise safeguarding measures
Black hat => use footprint to steal information
