After the hack complish footprint what should hack do next
	port scanning => invovles collecting information about the services arunning on the target system.
					 -> help hackers select the required tools and determine the next steps in hacking
		- Determine the range of the target network by studying the details IP addresses, which uniquely
		  identify systems on the internet. It is important to know that some addresses may be listed using
		  the CIDR notation, such as 10.0.0.0/16. the CIDR notation can provide information about the routing
		  IP packets.
		- probe each port, or a group of specifically targeted ports
		- Map open ports using applications such as OpenVAS to identify the actual applications and services running
		  on those ports.
Vulnerability scanning 
		hacker  => identify vulnerable services that they can attack
		security professional => identify vulnerabilities in the computer systems on a network to determine if 
								 and where a system can be exploited and threatened.
System exploit => a tool hackers use to break into a system and security personnel use to find out vulnerabilities in a
				  system. 
privilege escalation => the process of escalating the privileges of a user account to a level where increased access and fewer restrictions are in place

importance of port scanning
	=> it helps an organization identify externally accessible services. 
vulnerability scanning 
	=> helps organizations verify that the services they offer are patched and secure. 
why would attackers scan systems and networks
	=> scan systems and networks to find, and potentially access or attack, the servers and services running on those systems.
