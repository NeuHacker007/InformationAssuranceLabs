Questions

1. What are the five steps of ethical hacking
	the five steps are reconnaissance, scan target, vulnerability analysis, exploition, post-attack activities
2. During the reconnaissance step of teh attack, what open ports were discovered by Zenmap? What services were running on those ports
During the reconnaissance step, from the result of Zenmap, we found total 23 open ports and each port provides a specific services. These open ports and services are list below
Port	Protocol	State		Services
21	Tcp	open	ftp
22	Tcp	Open	ssh
23 	Tcp 	Open	telnet
25	Tcp	Open	smtp
53	Tcp	Open	domain
80	Tcp 	Open 	http
111	Tcp	Open	rpcbind
139	Tcp	Open	netbios-ssn
445	Tcp	Open	netbios-ssn
512	Tcp 	Open	exec
513	Tcp	Open	login
514	Tcp	Open 	shell
1099	Tcp	Open	java-rmi

3. What step in the hacking attack process uses Zenmap
We use Zenmap in the reconnaissance stage of hacking attack process because it returns the information about possible OS of target, t
he currently running services and open ports. Based on this information, we can do next step to further explore the potential weakness of our system.

4. What step in the hacking attack process identifies know vulnerabilities?
Basically, we identify the vulnerabilities in the step of scan target and after finishing the scanning, 
we will do analysis of these vulnerabilities, which represents that we are in vulnerability analysis step.

5. During the vulnerability scan, you identified a vulnerable service in the Linux victim system. What was the name of the vulnerable service?


6. If you are a member of a security penetration testing team, and you identify vulnerabilities and exploits, should you obtain written permission
   from the owners prior to compromising and exploiting the known vulnerability
   
 Of course as an ethical hacker, before we do anything to our client, we should ask written permission first. 
 Without this permission ethical hacker becomes an attacker which might be arrested by government agency because the unauthorized hacking is illegal.
