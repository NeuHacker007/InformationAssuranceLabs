Questions

1. why should a network administrator use Wireshark and NetWitness Investigator together
Wireshark has powerful capability to capture network packets but its result is hard to read and analysis and NetWitness can help us to read the result of Wireshark, which
provides a excellent analysis ability on packets but it cannot capture packets over network. So, we need to use both tools to do capture and analysis.

2. What was the IP address for LanSwitchl?
172.16.8.5

3. When the 172.16.8.5 IP host responded to the ICMP echo-requests, how many ICMP echo-reply packets were sent back to the vWorkstation?
	4
4. What was the terminal password for LanSwitch1 and LanSwitch 2?
LanSwitch1：cisco LanSwitch2：cisco 


5. When using SSH to remotely access a Cisco router, can you see the terminal password? why or why not
 when we use SSH to remote access a Cisco router, we cannot see the terminal password because all the traffic are
 encrypted instead of transmitting in a manner of clear text. 
6. What were the Destination IP addresses discovered by the NetWitness Investigator analysis?
	the destination IP addresses might not be the original destination IP address because when Wireshark works,
	it shows the source IP and detination IP of a packet at that capturing time.
7. Are packet-capturing tools like Wireshark less dangerous on switched LANs
 Wireshark is so powerful that no matter which type of network we use, we can use it to capture all packets on one
 or several interfaces. If the traffic is not encrypted properly, using SSH for example, through capture results we
 can know the clear text of password or file contents.
