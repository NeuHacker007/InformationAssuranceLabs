Security assessment => validate that established mechanisms work as intended and points out weaknesses or gaps in your security posture.
IT security audit => the logical extension of established policies and procedures that set the protocols and parameters for a system
				- verification => ensuring that established security controls meet policies and regulatory and mandatory laws
				- validation => ensuring that security controls function against various types of attacks and teh attempted manipulation
				- Testing => using manual or automated means to verify security controls and examining their effectivenes
				- Evaluation => examining how well security controls and personnel respond to alarming events.
Purpose of IT Audit => tests a system to ensure that the policies and procedures are correct for business needs, controls are in place to support these policies,
					   and procedures are properly followed and maintained.

Difference between IT security assessment & IT security audit 
						- An audit will verify that you have taken adequate measures to protect sensitive data
						- an assessment will validate weaknesses that are not addressed by policies.
Ethical hacking (penetration testing) => helps expose and prove inherent weaknesses that must be addressed by administrators and security professionals.
										 it seeks to expose a broad range of security issues.
							
Security Assessment process 
	- Define the assessment plan
		=> When planning an assessment, the assessor should look at the people, process, and technology of the organization and determine what the assessment will focus on.
		- Identify scope objectives
			=> The assessor defines the boundaries of the assessment plan and establishes specific areas to be assessed.
			- Establish assessment benchmarks and baselines
				=> help assessor establish a system of measurements.
				- collect assessment data
					=> assessor conducts interviews with managers and end users, review logs, and checks system and network.
					- target items that can be exploited
						=> target applications, connections, protocols, services, and users that can be exploited. the assessor identify items which pose the greatest vulnerabilities.
						- Validate mechanisms and identify weakness
							=> assessor checks access controls and countermeasures and runs vulnerability tests to determine security gaps and weaknesses. 
Security audit process
	- define the audit plan
		=> includes surveying the site and reviewing documentation, risk analysis output, logs and the results of penetration tests.
		- identify scope objectives
			=> defines the boundaries of the plan and establishes specific areas to audit so that one audit doesn't interfere with another audit being conducted.
			- establish audit benchmarks and baselines
				=> guidlines
						-> ISO - International Oraganization for Standarization
						-> NIST - National institute of standards and technology
						-> ITIL - Information technology information library 
						-> COBIT - Control objectives for information and related Technology
						-> COSO - Committee of Sponsoring organizations
				- collect audi data
					=> collect audit data and conduct interviews.
					- review policies and procedures
						=> Select and review policies, procedures, and planning documents.
						- Verify accuravy of controls and compliance.
							=> checks the identity-management system for approval processes, verifies that the authentication mechanisms work, checks for password
							   and policy enforcement, verifies that monitoring systems are in place and working, and checks that remote access systems use strong
							   authentication. 
Information systems security officer => help with planning, approving, and executing assessments and audits.
Network and systems administrators => assisst the assessors and auditors in network and system access and to provide background information when needed.
Managers and data owners => they must be available to address questions from assessors and auditors and to participate in postmortem meetings to discuss potential
							changes to systems and networks and the impact of the same on the staff.
User => cooperate fully with the assessment and auditing teams and understand that some services might be slow or unavailable during the testing phase.
auditors => define the objectives of the audit and determine which systems or business processes to review.
penetration testers or ethinical hacker => run a series of probes and tests on a netowrk or a system to try to infiltrate it exactly like a hacker would. these testers are
										   usually certified and must sign client agreements that they will act in an ethical manner while conducting tests.
real-time monitoring => responding to incidents as they occur.
		- Host intrusion prevention system (HIPS) -> can deny and disrupt a live attack on a system and helps protect services from manipulation
			=> monitors individual hosts for suspicious ativities.
		- Network intrusion prevention system(NIPS) -> can intercept and interrupt a live attack on the network and can help remove the malicious content of the attack.
			=> monitors the entire network for suspicious traffic
		- Wireless intrusion prevention system(WIPS)
			=> specifically monitors the wireless network for suspicious.
	eg. 
		Authentication failures
		application crashes
		service disruptions
		System intrusions
		Network abuses
		policy violation
		unauthorized activities
		inventory changes
