Setting a strong password policy is one of the first steps in implementing a comprehensive security program. Weak passwords allow 
unauthorized access to your network, and by extension, the sensitive documents, proprietary code, and accounting files stored on it. 
A strong policy itself is not enough. Continuous monitoring for login success and failure is a good way to detect mischief on the 
network. An overabundance of failures from a particular user account can indicate a brute force attack. Equally suspicious are 
successful accesses at odd times or while a given resource is on vacation.

The organization you are working for has updated their password policy. You are charged with implementing that policy in the 
securelabsondemand.com domain. The new password policy must meet the following criteria.

    · Users may not reuse any of the last 5 passwords
    · Users must change passwords every 30 days
    · Passwords may be reset at any time
    · Password must be a minimum of 10 characters
    · Password must meet basic complexity
    · Enforce Domain Policy over Organizational Unit Policy
    · Users must be “locked out” for 10 minutes, after failing to log in 3 times in a row
    · All login successes and failures must be logged

In the next steps, you will implement the organization’s password policy using Group Policy. Group Policy uses a layered approach to 
apply policy at the Local Server, Domain, and Sub-domain (Organizational Unit) level. Policy set the Organizational Unit level take 
precedence over Domain and Local Policies. Local Policies are overridden by both Domain and Organizational Unit policies. 
Thus, the order of precedence is: Organizational Unit > Domain > Local. In this policy change, you will change the order of precedence.
