Physical security controls
	- Monitoring: cameras, guards and motion sensors
	- Access control: Trunstiles, man traps, biometrics, and locks
	- Secure construction: Doors, walls, and bollards
	- Environmental protection: smoke detectors, sprinklers, water detectors and temperature sensors

IDSs 
	=> An IDS is a hardware appliance or a software-based device that gathers and analyzes information generated by a computer or a network
	   An IDS provides 
		- monitor a network, host / application
		- detect and report suspicious activities 
IPSs
	=> An IPS is a device used to protect systems from attack by implementing different methods of access control. An IPS is an IDS with additional
	   abilities that make it possible to protect a network. IPS can be either host-based or network-based.
	
Firewalls
	=> controlling the flow of traffic between different zones. 
	=> located on the perimeter of an organization's internal network.
	=> forms a logical and a physical barrier between an organization's network and the world outside.

Honeynets/Honeypots
	=> a honeypot is a single system put in place to attract an attacker and buy more reaction time in the event of an attack. 
	=> A honeypot is a decoy that is set to detect, deflect, or counteract attempts of unauthorized access to information systems. 
honeynets
	=> the networks created to allow hackers to attempt attacks, similar to a honeypot.
Darknets
	=> sections of unused, Internet-accessible Internet Protocol space that are monitored for traffic. 
	   any traffic to this unused space is considered suspicious because no publicly advertised hosts exist within it.
	   A darknet can be used to gather information about attacks, such as worms, port scans, and other access, to a network.
	   
preventive security controls
	- administrative 
		=> fits in the area of policies and procedures. they include rules that individuals and the company follow to ensurea safe
		   and ocnsistently secure working environment. some of the administrative controls are the principle of least privilege and
		   separation of duties, job rotation, and mandatory vacation. 
	- physical
		=> designed to directly protect people, facilities, and equipment. some of the preventive physical security controls are 
		   alternate power sources, flood management, human guards, and biometrics.
	- Technical
		=> work with other controls to create a robust security system. preventive logical ocntrols include access control,
		   software, malware solutions, passwords, security tokens, and antivirus software.
