Nearly every day there are reports of information security breaches and resulting monetary losses in the news. 
Businesses and governments have increased their security budgets and undertaken measures to minimize the loss from security breaches. 
 cyber laws act as a broad deterrent, internal controls are needed to secure networks from malicious activity. 
 Internal controls traditionally fall into two major categories: prevention and detection.

Intrusion prevention systems (IPS) block the IP traffic based on the filtering criteria that the information systems security 
practitioner must configure. Typically, the LAN-to-WAN domain and Internet ingress/egress point is the primary location for IPS devices. 
Second to that would be internal networks that have or require the highest level of security and protection from unauthorized access. 
If you can prevent the IP packets from entering the network or LAN segment, then a remote attacker can't do any damage.

A host-based intrusion detection system (IDS) is installed on a host machine, such as a server, and monitors traffic to and from the 
server and other items on the system. A network-based IDS deals with traffic to and from the network and does not have access to 
directly interface with the host. Intrusion detection systems are alert-driven, but they require the information systems security 
practitioner to configure them properly. An IDS provides the ability to monitor a network, host or application, and report back when 
suspicious activity is detected, but it does not block the activity.
