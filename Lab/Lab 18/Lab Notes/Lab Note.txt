The airmon-ng tool is used to enable the monitor mode on wireless LAN interfaces. 
It may also be used to toggle between the monitor mode and the managed mode. 
Entering the airmon-ng command without parameters will show the interface's status on the WLAN.


The airodump-ng tool is used for packet capturing of raw 802.11 frames and is particularly suitable for collecting WEP initialization 
vectors with the intent of using them with aircrack-ng. 
With a GPS receiver connected to the computer, airodump-ng is also capable of logging the coordinates of the access points 
that have been found. 
Additionally, airodump-ng creates files containing the details of all access points and clients found on that WLAN, 
similar to an IP discovery after an Nmap scan.

The aireplay-ng tool is used to inject frames. 
The primary function of this injection is to generate traffic that aircrack-ng will use later for cracking the 
WEP and WPA-PSK keys. 
There are different attacks that can cause de-authentications for capturing WPA handshake data, 
fake authentications, interactive packet replay, handcrafted ARP request injection, and ARP-request reinjection. 

The aircrack-ng tool is an 802.11 WEP and WPA-PSK keys cracking program 
that can recover keys once enough data packets have been captured.
