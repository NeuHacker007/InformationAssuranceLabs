Most widely used wireless technologies
	- 802.11 a/b/g/n
	- Bluetooth
	- Infrared
	- Radio Requency Identification
	- Cell phones
	- Alternate wireless technologies, including worldwide interoperability for Microwave Access and similar long-range wireless technologies
Vulnerability of Bluetooth
	- It allows for discovery-mode settings
	- includes pairing protection of authentication and authorization
	- poorly implemented by some vendors
	- Bluetooth service authorization mode can be vulnerable because some devices accept all incoming file transfers or pair automatically
	- Bluetooth worms Cabir and Mabir use both Bluetooth and multimedia messaging service.
	- buletooth operates as part of a network stack and may expose the host operating systems to attacks
	- Bluetooth devices may be uniquely identified; therefore, Bluetooth may be used to find the position of or to track a device.

Vulnerability of wireless technologies 
	- send unencrypted traffic can allow monitoring from a distance
	- can be located by triangulation 
	- receive interference, preventing the use of a network 
	- Most other threats are common to both wired and wireless netoworks, such as denial of service and host-and service-based attacks.

SSID => used to identify a network and is represented as a 32 character sequence. the SSID helps clients locate the correct wireless local area network
