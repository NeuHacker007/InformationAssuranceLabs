Strong encryption
	- use a "peer-reviewed" algorithm 
	- appropriate configuration and keeps keys a secret
	- a well-defined cipher in a secure encironment

Weak encryption	
	- uses a "secret" algorithm and recoverable keys
	- poorly chosen bit length for data sensitivity or odd bit lengths for "added security"
	- uses a broken cipher or one with known flaws
