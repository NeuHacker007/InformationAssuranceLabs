Common web server vulnerabilities
	- Easily accessible source code
	- Server software attacks
	- Server plug-ins
Common web application vulnerabilities
	- Cross-Site Scripting
		=> allow attackers to inject script code into Web Pages viewed by others. this might
		   result in the exploitation of trust users have in the web site.
	- Structured Query Language injection
		=> insert SQL commands into requests sent by Web applications, protentially exposing data,
		   deleting information from the database, or leading to other database-focused attacks.
	- Cross-Site Request Forgery(CSRF/XSRF)
		=> A CSRF attack attempts to make a trusted user send commands for the attacker. this type
		  of attack attempts to exploit the trust a web site has in a user.
tools for detecting 
	- WebInspect
		=> a commercial tool for testing Web applications and Web servers	
	- Nikto
		=> an open-source Web server scanner that tests for dangerous configurations, files, 
		   and Common Gateway Interface scripts.
	- Search engines
		=> used to find incorrectly configured applications and servers and identify exposed configurations
		   files and other common issues. 
Database attacks => attacks that are intended to harm the repository of data on Web servers.
	- Injection
		=> Queries injected via a Web application can cause a database to divulge information or to delete
		   or add data.
	- Default user name and password
		=> allow attackers direct access to a database, exposing data or even potentially allowing full control.
	- Brute force password cracking
		=> Databases that are not protected against brute force attacks can be attacked by trying every possible
		   password
