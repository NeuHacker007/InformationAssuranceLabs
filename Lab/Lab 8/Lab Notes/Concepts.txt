OSI => organizes protocols and services in levels of ordered operations. The protocol stack, or network stack, refers to layered network protocols in the OSI model
	1. Physical => Defines electrical and physical device specifications and the relationships between physical devices.
					Ethernet cabling functions at this layer
	2. Data link => Provides the means to transfer data between network endpoints. 
					most switches operate at this layered
	3. Network => Provides the means for delivering variable-length data between networks. 
					routers operate at this layer.
	4. Transport => Establishes reliable services and user connection or datagram-oriented packets. 
					TCP / UDP 
	5. Session => Establishes, manages, and terminates connections locally and remotely 
					remote procedure calls
	6. Presentation => Establishes context between application layer entities.
	
	7. Application => Interacts with software that uses a communication protocol. this layer is colest to teh end user with direct application interaction.
					 It serves to identify parties, determine service availability and synchoronize end-to-end communications.
					 HTTP, FTP, Email
TCP 
	- Ip packets contain source and destination addresses to transmit data 
	- IP resides on the lower levels and encapsulates upper-layer packets to send them across the network 
	- TCP builds reliable connection-oriented transmission. 
	- IP encapsulates TCP to connect sources with destinations using certain ports and a specific service protocol.
TCP weakness => TCP is a insecure protocol suite and it was designed when the computer security is not a major problem 
	- There are insufficient authentication controls for remote users.
	- There are no enforced health checks against remote clients
	- Unprotected services are accessible from the Internet.
	- There are issues related to the disclosure of shared file system information
	- The model is susceptible to DoS attacks.

Encapsulation => As data moves from a software application for transmission over the network, it traverses the layer of 
				 the protocol stack from top to bottom. As each layer receives data from the layer above it, that data 
				 becomes the payload with a layer-specific header. at the data link layer, where Ethernet resides, the 
				 data receives a footer, as well.
Network topology => how devices and systems interconnect. It refers to the arrangement, or hierarchy of how networked 
					devices connect. 
			- Bus
				=> Nodes connect to a shared backbone, and data is broadcasted to all devices.
			- Rings 
				=> Nodes are connected in a circle, and data traverses throughout the network ring to all devices.
			- Star
				=> Nodes are connect to a central hub, and data passes directly to individual hosts.
			- Line 
				=> Nodes connect to each other in a line 
			- Tree
				=> Serveral star networks are attached to a bus
			- Mesh
				=>Every device is interconnected, and data takes several paths
network topology can help enforce security policies in an information technology infrastructure. Isolated segments for development and production servers and
user groups compartmentailize risk because
	- Keeping users separate helps minimize exposure
	- Separate segments are easier to control and monitor.
	- It isolates remote mobile user groups from internal user groups.
